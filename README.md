<h2>Course 3: Natural Language Processing in TensorFlow</h2>
<ol>
 <li><b>Week 1: Sentiment in text</b>: The first step in understanding sentiment in text, and in particular when training a neural network to do so is the tokenization of that text. This is the process of converting the text into numeric values, with a number representing a word or a character. This week you'll learn about the Tokenizer and pad_sequences APIs in TensorFlow and how they can be used to prepare and encode text and sentences to get them ready for training neural networks!<ul>
  <li><b>Labs (Solved)</b>:</li>
  <li><b>Asignment (Solved)</b>:</li>
  </ul> </li>
 <li><b>Week 2: Word Embeddings</b>: This week you'll learn about Embeddings, where these tokens are mapped as vectors in a high dimension space. With Embeddings and labelled examples, these vectors can then be tuned so that words with similar meaning will have a similar direction in the vector space. This will begin the process of training a neural network to understand sentiment in text -- and you'll begin by looking at movie reviews, training a neural network on texts that are labelled 'positive' or 'negative' and determining which words in a sentence drive those meanings.<ul>
  <li><b>Labs (Solved)</b>:</li>
  <li><b>Asignment (Solved)</b>:</li>
  </ul> </li>
 <li><b>Week 3: Sequence models</b>: Sentiment can also be determined by the sequence in which words appear. For example, you could have 'not fun', which of course is the opposite of 'fun'. This week you'll start digging into a variety of model formats that are used in training models to understand context in sequence!<ul>
  <li><b>Labs (Solved)</b>:</li>
  <li><b>Asignment (Solved)</b>:</li>
  </ul> </li>
 <li><b>Week 4: Sequence models and literature</b>:  Given a body of words, you could conceivably predict the word most likely to follow a given word or phrase, and once you've done that, to do it again, and again. With that in mind, this week you'll build a poetry generator. It's trained with the lyrics from traditional Irish songs, and can be used to produce beautiful-sounding verse of it's own!<ul>

<h2>Course 4: Sequences, Time Series and Prediction</h2>
<ol>
 <li><b>Week 1: Sequences and Prediction</b>: take a look at some of the unique considerations involved when handling sequential time series data -- where values change over time, like the temperature on a particular day, or the number of visitors to your web site. We'll discuss various methodologies for predicting future values in these time series, building on what you've learned in previous courses!<ul>
  <li><b>Labs (Solved)</b>:</li>
  <li><b>Asignment (Solved)</b>:</li>
  </ul> </li>
 <li><b>Week 2: Deep Neural Networks for Time Series</b>: Having explored time series and some of the common attributes of time series such as trend and seasonality, and then having used statistical methods for projection, let's now begin to teach neural networks to recognize and predict on time series!<ul>
  <li><b>Labs (Solved)</b>:</li>
  <li><b>Asignment (Solved)</b>:</li>
